# **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**

##  Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on social media text data to classify user opinions into **Positive, Neutral,** or **Negative** sentiments.
By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, the model can assist in understanding public opinion, brand perception, and online discourse trends.

##  Dataset

* **Source:** *(Add dataset source link or description)*
* **Total Records:** *Number of rows in your dataset*
* **Features:**

  | Column Name       | Description                                                          |
  | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `clean_text`      | Preprocessed and cleaned text                                        |
  | `sentiment`       | Numerical sentiment label (-1 = Negative, 0 = Neutral, 1 = Positive) |
  | `sentiment_label` | Categorical sentiment label ("Negative", "Neutral", "Positive")      |

##  Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Removal of punctuation, special characters, and stopwords
   * Text tokenization and lowercasing
   * Mapping numerical sentiment values to descriptive labels

2. **Trainâ€“Test Split**

   * Dataset divided into 80% training and 20% testing

3. **Feature Extraction**

   * **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical feature vectors

4. **Model Training**

   * Machine Learning models tested:

     * Logistic Regression
     * Multinomial Naive Bayes
     * Random Forest Classifier

5. **Evaluation**

   * Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   * Confusion matrix for performance visualization

##  Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | XX%      | XX        | XX     | XX       |
| Naive Bayes         | XX%      | XX        | XX     | XX       |
| Random Forest       | XX%      | XX        | XX     | XX       |

* **Best Performing Model:** *Model name here*
* **Key Insight:** *(Brief observation from your results)*

If you want, I can now **replace all placeholders (XX%, dataset source, and best model)** with your actual project details so you get a **ready-to-submit README.md**.
Do you want me to fill those in with your exact values?
